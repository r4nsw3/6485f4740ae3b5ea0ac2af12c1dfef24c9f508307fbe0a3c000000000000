  |   In 1998, one game made huge waves within its genre: Guilty Gear for   |
  |   the original PlayStation. Spectacular special moves that brought      |
  |   the console to its limits, a hard rock soundtrack that still has to   |
  |   meet its match, innovative mechanics and unique characters that       |
  |   kicked off an incredibly complex and epic anime story will equally    |
  |   fascinate fighting game fans today, as it did 20 years ago!           |
